1. synset_data class is defined with attributes: Synset ID, noun array, synonym definition

2. A hash map with Integer key (Synset ID) and synset data value(Noun , synonym definition) is used to store all the values

synset_data class should be encapsulated well to store all its attributes. HashMap is used to store (synsetID, synset data) combination so that retrieval of data based on ID is faster and efficient.

1. To store the relationship as defined by hypernym file, adjacency list is used. An arraylist contains TreeNode objects with Synset ID for all the synsets. TreeNode object of every vertex contains the next reference object to TreeNode objects of adjacent vertices. 

Adjacency matrix is not used to store the graph as it is not efficient in terms of performance. So adjacency list pointing to a linked list of adjacent verties are used.
